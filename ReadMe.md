# Puffin Peril

A simple 2D desktop game in Godot expanding on the "First 2D game" tutorial.

Help the puffin to catch as many fish as possible in 30 seconds whilst avoiding being stung by jellyfish or pinched by crabs!

Complete with authentic puffin noises [(thanks BBC Sound Effects)](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?q=puffin) !
